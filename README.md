## A Simple Command Framework for ActionScript

Not... really relevant anymore considering the mass exedous from the Flash Platform.  However this was a mighty simple command framework that could be used in ActionScript.  Kind of Promisy, chainable and overall pretty nifty.

Don't use it.  Write JavaScript instead.  It lives on here for posterity because I used it in so many ding dang projects.
